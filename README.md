# LightCoin Assignment:

## LightCoin (LHL) Crypto App
You've been hired to work on a new crypto currency app to manage LightCoins (aka LHL coins).

### Note
People keep confusing LightCoin with the more popular LiteCoin, but our branding team is adamant that it will stick.

The project has already started and some code was already written.


## Features:

Here's a list of features that our code needs to support:

Allow multiple accounts to be created
Each account can have many transactions
Allow withdrawals and deposits into accounts
Allow us to retrieve the transaction history of an account (all withdrawals and deposits)
Allow us to retrieve the current balance of the account at any time
Don't allow withdrawals that exceed the remaining balance of the account
